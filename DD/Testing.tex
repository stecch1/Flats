\chapter{Testing}
The application shows all houses available for rent on a map through Google Maps API. Because of Google Maps API and Firebase, the possibility to run several unit tests is limited.  We consequently targeted our tests aiming to check the correct performance of the forms and to verify if errors messages are shown when needed.  In particular, we have tested login and register form and added house form in Host section. Regarding registration phase, we have checked that emails must be in a correct format and password must be longer than 6 characters.

On the other hand, We made a lots of widget tests to verify that the widgetâ€™s UI looks and interacts as expected. 

When testing, we stressed the app by performing several unusual actions by the user and by checking that the interface kept working as intended in order to exclude any graphic glitches.
