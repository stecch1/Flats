\chapter{Effort Spent}
The development of our app took place between November 2021 and January 2022.

We worked in team on site and remotely to setup the crucial parts of the application but we also worked on our own with continuous mutual contacts.

We didnâ€™t use any professional time tracker, but we estimate that the hours spent are around 150 per worker and can be roughly splitted as follows:
\begin{itemize}
    \item 15\% platform meet and greet
    \item 65\% development
    \item 10\% testing
    \item 10\% document drafting
\end{itemize}
